Recipe module.  WIP

It's just a recipe editor right now.  Right-click a recipe, weapon, or armor to get an Edit Recipe context menu item.  Editing a recipe edits it "in place."  Editing a weapon or armor creates a new recipe that produces that item, and prompts you to save it as a new record when you're done.
